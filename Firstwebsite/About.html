<H1>About Me</H1>
<p>
  A little about me.  I have been working in Technology since 2002.  I graduated from Sanford Brown College in Fenton
  Missouri.  One of the few who actually graduated with a bachelors degree in IT.  From there it would be easier to say
  what I have not done. <br>
  I have supported Industrial, Health Care, and Financial.  While working for Mercy Healthcare in
  Saint Louis Missouri I received an Master of Business Administration from Lindenwood University.  After completing my
  MBA with 3.8 GPA, I was enrolled in a Pilot program to satisfy the Education Requirement for the Project Management Professional.
  I completed that course with a 3.45 GPA and received a Masters of Science in Administration.  <br>
  When it comes to technology you name it and I have probably supported it.  I have worked for:
  <ul>
  <li>Tek Systems</li>
  <li>Army Air Force Exchange Service</li>
  <li>Mercy HealthCare</li>
  <li>US Department of Agriculture</li>
  <li>The list goes on.</li>
</ul>
